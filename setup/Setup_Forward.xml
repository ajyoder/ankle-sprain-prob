The first column contains the time.  The rest of the columns contain the states in the order appropriate for the model. In a storage file, unlike a motion file (.mot), non-uniform time spacing is allowed.  If the user-specified initial time for a simulation does not correspond exactly to one of the time stamps in this file, inerpolation is NOT used because it is usually necessary to being a simulation from an exact set of states.  Instead, the closest earlier set of states is used. Having a states file that contains the entire trajectory of a simulations allows for corrective springs for perturbation analysis to be added.-->

		<!--Flag (true or false) indicating whether or not the integrator should use a particular time stepping.  If true, the time stepping is extracted from the initial states file.  In this situation, therefore, the initial states file must contain all the time steps in a simulation and be written out to high precision (usually 20 decimal places).  Setting this flag to true can be useful when reproducing a previous forward simulation with as little drift as possible.  If this flag is false, the integrator is left to determine its own time stepping.-->
